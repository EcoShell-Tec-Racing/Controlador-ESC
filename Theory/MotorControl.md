### Motor Control Explanation

This controller employs a six-step control commutation technique, commonly referred to as "Trapezoidal Commutation." The name stems from the trapezoidal shape of the back electromotive force (back-EMF) waveform generated in the motor windings during operation. In this method, the motor's phases are energized in a specific sequence based on the rotor's position, which is typically determined using Hall effect sensors (integrated within the hub motor). Trapezoidal commutation is favored for its simplicity and efficiency.
